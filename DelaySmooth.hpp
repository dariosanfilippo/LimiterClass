/*******************************************************************************
 *
 * Mono-input, mono-output delay line with an efficient wrap-around method.
 * The reading and writing heads use fixed-width unsigned int types, 
 * which can overflow safely. The limitation of this design is that buffers 
 * allocation is limited to 2^8, 2^16, 2^32, or 2^64 elements. Of course,
 * only the first two sizes are feasible, hence this technique is convenient
 * for delays that are 256 or 65536 samples maximum.
 *
 * The delay line uses two parallel delay lines among which crossfade takes 
 * place for click-free and Doppler-free delay variations.
